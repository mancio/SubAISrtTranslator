## SubAISrtTranslator   

### Translate your .srt files

### How to use:
* run the script with your Open-Ai key as parameter
* Select your model
* tune it by changing threads number and sleeping time in case it slow down and lose connection

### NOTE
After some translation you will see it slowing down and try multiple times reconnection. 
This happens due to the open AI limitation.
Fortunately the script is design to try again multiple times to avoid missing translations
